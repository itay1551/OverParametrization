# Over Paramerization project using VIT

**How use the code**
1. install the envaroment.yaml as conda envaroment
2. run vit_cifar.ipynb

The image illustrates the iterative recovery process of corrupted images. Starting from the left, the image shows the initial corrupted input followed by multiple iterations leading to a final restored image on the right.

## 3. Corrupted vs. Recovered Train Examples
